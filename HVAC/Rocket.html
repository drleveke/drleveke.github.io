    <h3>Why HVAC Rocket 3.0?</h3>
    <p>
      HVAC Rocket 3.0 is the next evolution of home services software. 
      Built on decades of hands‑on experience in call centers, dispatch, 
      and the field, Rocket takes the proven systems of Ticket Writer and Bidder 
      and supercharges them with AI. It is the open‑source alternative to 
      expensive platforms like ServiceTitan, designed for the small shop 
      owner who wants to grow without paying $60,000 a year in software fees.

      <h3>The History</h3>

  <h3>The History</h3>
  <p>
    The story of HVAC Rocket begins at <strong>ACE Air</strong> in Phoenix in the early 2000s. 
    At the time, the company was co‑run by Frank Valdez, Dave, and Mike Scouten — and Cody’s father, 
    David Meyers, was right in the middle of it. David had only a 9th‑grade education, was dyslexic, 
    and had served time in federal prison, but he was brilliant with people and hungry to succeed. 
    He began as a telemarketer, became one of the best in the business, and then helped pioneer 
    the first custom systems to manage call centers and dispatching. With Mike Scouten programming, 
    they created <em>Tracker</em> (dispatch) and <em>Virtual Display</em> (telemarketing screens) 
    on top of Marketel MKII dialers — 1990s tech that they hacked into a new level of efficiency. 
    The system was crude by modern standards, but it worked. It tracked leads, scheduled calls, 
    dispatched jobs, and paid marketers when they landed sales. For the first time, 
    Phoenix call centers were running off software built inside the industry instead of bought off the shelf.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the next several years, the Tracker/VD system spread into other companies: 
    <strong>Precision Air</strong>, <strong>Desert Valley Aire</strong>, 
    and other Phoenix operators used it to fuel their growth. The system became a quiet 
    backbone of the industry, known by insiders but never sold on the open market. 
    By 2008, call centers across the Valley were dialing tens of thousands of numbers 
    and filling schedules every day with appointments — years before modern SaaS platforms 
    like ServiceTitan even existed.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2009, Cody Leveke — fresh out of Iowa State with a Mechanical Engineering degree — 
    joined the family business at Desert Valley Aire. He came in with computer skills, 
    networking knowledge, and an engineer’s eye for systems. While his father was 
    managing operations and expanding into Dallas, Houston, and Tucson, Cody began 
    modernizing the technology. He experimented with <strong>Vicidial</strong>, an open‑source dialer, 
    and discovered he could replace the expensive Marketel systems with Linux servers 
    that cost a fraction of the price. This was the birth of <strong>Ticket Writer 2.0</strong> — 
    a web‑based system that tied Vicidial to <strong>Vtiger CRM</strong>. 
    For the first time, when a call came in, the marketer could click a button, 
    see a pre‑filled web form with the homeowner’s info, and schedule an appointment 
    into a shared calendar. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The software continued to evolve as Cody moved into new ventures. At <strong>US Air</strong>, 
    the system was deployed at scale. With <strong>SMW Refrigeration</strong>, Cody built out a full call center 
    with 15 marketing stations and integrated payroll, commissions, and QuickBooks reporting. 
    At <strong>Rescue One Air</strong> and <strong>Emergency Air</strong>, the system was customized to work with 
    proprietary CRMs like ESC. Later, it even found its way outside of HVAC — 
    <strong>United Hail Pros</strong> (UHP) in Colorado used a version to run their storm restoration sales, 
    proving the system could adapt to any home services model.
  </p>
  <p>
    Along the way, new modules were added: <strong>Bidder</strong>, which let techs in the field build 
    replacement quotes on their phone with financing fees and profit margins baked in; 
    a commission calculator that turned a week of accountant’s work into one click; 
    and even early experiments with geo‑optimized scheduling and pulling home data from Zillow. 
    These were innovations that the market would not see commercially until years later 
    when ServiceTitan appeared with venture funding and slick marketing. 
    But the truth is, by 2013, HVAC Rocket’s predecessors were already doing 
    predictive dialing, integrated scheduling, tech bidding, commissions, and customer 
    lifecycle tracking in Phoenix — <em>before ServiceTitan was ServiceTitan</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    HVAC Rocket 3.0 is the rebirth of all those ideas — open‑source, AI‑powered, 
    and built for the small contractor who wants to grow without paying 
    $300 per tech per month. Born in the call centers of Phoenix, refined 
    through companies like ACE, Precision, Desert Valley, US Air, SMW, 
    Rescue One, Emergency Air, and UHP, this platform is the living history 
    of how software and hard‑knock experience combined to change an industry.
