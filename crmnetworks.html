  <h1>üöÄ Ticket Writer Version 3</h1>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><em>Born in the Call Centers of Phoenix ‚Ä¢ Refined in the Dungeon of the Feds</em></p>

  <h2>ACE Air ‚Äì The Beginning (2000s)</h2>
  <p>
    The roots of this software go back to <strong>ACE Air in Phoenix</strong>, where David Meyers (Cody‚Äôs father) and programmer 
    Mike Scouten built the first version of what would become Ticket Writer. The system was called 
    <strong>Tracker</strong> (for dispatch) and <strong>Virtual Display</strong> (for marketers). It used Access and VB6 to 
    connect telemarketers to dispatch in real time. This was <strong>Version 1.0</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>SMW Refrigeration ‚Äì Ticket Writer 2.0 (2013)</h2>
  <p>
    In 2013, Cody Leveke built <strong>Ticket Writer 2.0</strong> at <strong>SMW Refrigeration & Heating</strong>. It combined 
    <strong>VICIdial</strong> with <strong>vTiger CRM</strong>, using custom PHP webforms that prefilled lead data and automated 
    appointment scheduling. Agents could book jobs without overfilling slots, and cancelled calls automatically reopened 
    the schedule. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Cody also developed <strong>Bidder</strong>, a mobile-friendly tool that let techs generate real-time replacement quotes, 
    factoring in payment methods (cash, card, financing fees) and target margins. This eliminated endless phone calls 
    from the field and gave techs pricing power in their hands.
  </p>
  <p>
    At SMW, Ticket Writer was also integrated with <strong>QuickBooks Enterprise</strong>. A MySQL mirror of QB allowed 
    automated lead reactivation (customers overdue for maintenance were auto-added into VICIdial call lists) and 
    <strong>commission automation</strong> (20% service, 8% installs, bonuses after thresholds, only paid when QB marked 
    invoice as paid). What once took an accountant a week became a one-button process.
  </p>

  <h2>CRM Networks ‚Äì The Software Company (2016)</h2>
  <p>
    In 2016, Cody formed <strong>CRM Networks, LLC</strong> as the official software company to commercialize these tools. 
    Ticket Writer, Bidder, and related programs were deployed in multiple HVAC companies across Phoenix, including 
    Emergency Air and Rescue One Air (integrated with ESC instead of vTiger).
  </p>

  <h2>Legal Disputes and Interference</h2>
  <div class="highlight">
    <p>
      The success of Ticket Writer 2.0 brought legal challenges. Cody‚Äôs relationship with 
      <strong>SMW Refrigeration & Heating, LLC</strong> collapsed, and disputes with Scott Wetter and others led to 
      restraining orders, false criminal charges, and years of federal incarceration.  
    </p>
    <p>
      These actions derailed the business just as Ticket Writer was proving itself superior to expensive competitors 
      like ServiceTitan. Civil RICO complaints and tort claims are ongoing, with Cody fighting to hold accountable 
      those who interfered with the growth of CRM Networks. 
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Ticket Writer 3.0 ‚Äì Available Now</h2>
  <p>
    Today, the project is reborn as <strong>Ticket Writer Version 3</strong>. Built on VICIdial‚Äôs proven LAMP stack, 
    it integrates scheduling, bidding, invoicing, payroll, and AI call transcription into one unified platform. 
    The vision remains the same: empower HVAC companies with software ‚Äúfor the people‚Äù ‚Äî efficient, practical, and 
    battle-tested in the real world.
